# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm  for finding Minimum Spanning Trees in graphs for the needs of the course Advanced Topics Algorithms Implementation Technologies in Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics, University of Patras.<br><br>


Header file MST.hpp contains the class MST which implements:
1. Kruskal's algorithm
2. A checker function
3. A function that test the worst case of the algorithm

All algorithms are implemented in C++ using structures from the LEDA library (Algorithmic Solutions Software GmbH).<br>
In main function takes place a comparison between this algorithm and LEDA's algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree, for the following types of graphs:

<li>Random Consistent Graphs</li>
<li>Grid Graphs</li>
<li>Worst case scenario Graphs</li>


<b>Instructions:</b><br>
make<br>
./run<br><br>

(Note that LEDA library is needed.)
